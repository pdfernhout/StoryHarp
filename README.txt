Run using the main in TConsoleWindow.java.

This code was translated from Delphi to Java using a tool Paul Fernhout wrote to do
some of the heavy lifting, but requiring hand-clean up afterwards.

The basic application runs, but more complex parts of the application remain unported.
While the code runs, there remain syntactic errors in the code base related to porting 
that essentially indicate places needing more work.
